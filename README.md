For an award of a $10 Chipotle Gift Card, you can choose between two coding challenges:
1) Using any coding language, write a program that prints the next 20 leap years
2) Using any languagem write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse Code.

Fewest *lines* wins.

Assuming that I can only submit one program, I have chosen the leap years problem, as I do not have to store English/Morse Code dictionaries, and have higher potential for a one-liner.

Additionally, I talked with a friend, and we both believe that this is assuming pretty print style. Otherwise languages without mandatory indentation would win no matter what.

My goal: Try to solve the solution in the fewest bytes.
